### Project requirements
Alright, now it’s time to make your own _personal website_. Design a personal webpage about yourself. The project should be subject to the following requirements:
+ Your website must contain at least four different _`.html pages`_, and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more _`hyperlinks`_.
+ Your website must include at least one _`list (ordered or unordered)`_, at least one _`table`_, and at least one _`image`_.
+ You should also have some content placed within _`paragraph`_.
+ Your website must have at least one stylesheet file. The stylesheet(s) must use at least five different _`CSS properties`_, and at least five different types of _`CSS selectors`_. You must use the _`#id selector`_ at least once, and the _`.class selector`_ at least once.
