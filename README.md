# Web tutorial
### Project requirements
Alright, now it’s time to make your own _personal website_. Design a personal webpage about yourself. The project should be subject to the following requirements:
+ Your website must contain at least four different _`.html pages`_, and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more _`hyperlinks`_.
+ Your website must include at least one _`list (ordered or unordered)`_, at least one _`table`_, and at least one _`image`_.
+ You should also have some content placed within _`paragraph`_.
+ Your website must have at least one stylesheet file. The stylesheet(s) must use at least five different _`CSS properties`_, and at least five different types of _`CSS selectors`_. You must use the _`#id selector`_ at least once, and the _`.class selector`_ at least once.

### Let’s start with our development
The first things we shall do is to create a website directory on _`c driver`_ for storing our website files. We will be working on _`Git Bash terminal`_. Now, start by opening your Git bash terminal, then clicking inside your terminal after it has open, and then type the following command: _`cd c:/`_ followed by an Enter to move to _`c:/ drive`_.

```
cd c:/

```
_Here on out, to execute (i.e., run) a command means to type it into a git bash terminal and then hit Enter. Commands are “case-sensitive,” so be sure not to type in uppercase when you mean lowercase or vice versa._
