### Project requirements
Alright, now it’s time to make your own _personal website_. Design a personal webpage about yourself. The project should be subject to the following requirements:
+ Your website must contain at least four different _`.html pages`_, and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more _`hyperlinks`_.
+ Your website must include at least one _`list (ordered or unordered)`_, at least one _`table`_, and at least one _`image`_.
+ You should also have some content placed within _`paragraph`_.
+ Your website must have at least one stylesheet file. The stylesheet(s) must use at least five different _`CSS properties`_, and at least five different types of _`CSS selectors`_. You must use the _`#id selector`_ at least once, and the _`.class selector`_ at least once.

### Let’s start with our development
Let's start by creating a _website directory on `c driver`_ for storing all our personal website files. We will be working on _`Git Bash terminal`_ to create our _personal website directory_. Now, open your _Git bash terminal_, then click inside _terminal_ after it has open, and then _type_ the following command: _`cd c:/`_ followed by an _`Enter`_.

+ _`Change directory to move to c drive`_
![Move to c drive](./resources/cd_cdrive.png "Change directory to move to c drive")

_From here on out, to execute (i.e., run) a command means to type it into a git bash terminal and then hit Enter. Commands are “case-sensitive,” so be sure not to type in uppercase when you mean lowercase or vice versa._

+ _`Create a new directory called workspace on c drive`_.
![create directory](./resources/mkdir_workspace.png "Create a new directory called workspace on c drive")

To move yourself into _(i.e., open)_ that directory. _Our prompt should now resemble the below. Now, execute command below:_
![Move to workspace](./resources/cd_workspace.png "Move to workspace directory")

+ _`Create a new directory called dev-personal-site inside workspace folder or directory on c drive. Now, execute command below:`_
![create directory](./resources/mkdir_dev-personal-site.png "Create a new directory called dev-personal-site inside workspace folder or directory on c drive")

To move yourself into _(i.e., open)_ that directory. _Our prompt should now resemble the command below. Now, execute command below:_
![Move to dev-personal-site](./resources/cd_personal-site.png "Move to dev-personal-site directory")

We have  now successfully created _root directory_ of our _personal website_. Below is the list of _command we have used_:

| Command | Description                  |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| _cd_    | _Change directory._          |
| _mkdir_ | _To create a new directory._ |
